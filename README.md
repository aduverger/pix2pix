Try our notebook: &nbsp; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aduverger/pix2pix/blob/master/notebooks/elegant_facades.ipynb)

Image-to-image translation using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN).

The objective was to reproduce the [original research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) from Isola et al. to generate realistic building facades from sketches.

A website is available to try the fitted model, by uploading sketches or draw ones yourself : [yeswegan.herokuapp.com](https://yeswegan.herokuapp.com/)

You can also try the library with the Google Colab provided.
