# pix2pix

Image-to-image translation using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN).

The objective was to reproduce the [original research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) from Isola et al. to generate realistic building facades from sketches.

A website is available to try the fitted model, by uploading sketches or draw ones yourself : [yeswegan.herokuapp.com](https://yeswegan.herokuapp.com/)


# Put the API in prod

You need to download a `gen_pix2pix_400_model_save.h5` model at the root of the project
